        A Time Attack race is designed for those who love to set records – the
        open competition for road cars does not involve head-to-head fights
        among drivers during the sessions, but allows to feel the full speed,
        find ideal driving line and realise the full potential of your car. Each
        participant drives a certain number of laps around the Sochi Autodrom
        track and only the best lap of all the sessions counts. To try yourself
        at the best racing circuit of the country, you will need a car with
        summer tyres which is in a sound state and a helmet.
